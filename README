python-quilt
============

python-quilt is a python_ implementation of the well-known tool quilt_
to manage a series of patches.

It's intended to be used within a python application or framework but
also provides a console client interface called pquilt.

python-quilt only requires patch_ for creating and applying diffs.

Source code of python-quilt can be found at https://github.com/bjoernricks/python-quilt

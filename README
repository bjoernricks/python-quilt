python-quilt
============

python-quilt is a python_ implementation of the well-known tool quilt_
to manage a series of patches.

It's intended to be used within a python application or framework but
also provides a console client interface called pquilt.

python-quilt requires the Six package, <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>. It
also requires patch_ and diff_ for creating and applying diffs.

Source code of python-quilt can be found at https://github.com/bjoernricks/python-quilt
